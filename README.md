##  LARGE SPITS

Origin. The ancestors of this breed are the ancient canis familiaris palustris, so the Great Spitz can be considered the predecessor of all modern dog breeds. The remains of dogs that lived 10 thousand years ago were found during excavations in Asia, Africa and Northern Europe.

Description. These dogs must be at least 40 cm tall and weigh about 18 kg. The large Spitz has a medium-sized head, a wedge-shaped skull, a flattened nasal bridge with a black or brown lobe, depending on the color of the coat. The eyes are dark, slanted. The ears are small, pointed, triangular, erect. The tail is curled and carried over the back. The coat is thick and long everywhere except the muzzle, ears and paws, where it is shorter. Depending on the color of the large Spitz, they are divided into four varieties: wolf Spitz (silver-gray with black spots), black Spitz (skin, undercoat and guard hair are completely black), white Spitz (completely white, without a yellowish tint), brown Spitz (solid dark brown color). The Wolf Spitz may be slightly larger than other Large Spitz varieties.
 
Character. They are alive, loyal, smart, bark a lot, suspicious of strangers.

Application. These are decorative dogs that are so attached to their home that they are ready to protect it, like real watchmen. Physically and psychologically, these dogs mature at the age of three.
