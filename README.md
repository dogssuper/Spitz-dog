##  LARGE SPITS

The large Spitz has a medium-sized head, a wedge-shaped skull, a flattened nasal bridge with a black or brown lobe, depending on the color of the coat. The eyes are dark, slanted. The ears are small, pointed, triangular, erect. The tail is curled and carried over the back. The coat is thick and long everywhere except the muzzle, ears and paws, where it is shorter. Depending on the color of the large Spitz, they are divided into four varieties: wolf Spitz (silver-gray with black spots), black Spitz (skin, undercoat and guard hair are completely black), white Spitz (completely white, without a yellowish tint), brown Spitz (solid dark brown color). The Wolf Spitz may be slightly larger than other Large Spitz varieties.
 
Character. They are alive, loyal, smart, bark a lot, suspicious of strangers.
